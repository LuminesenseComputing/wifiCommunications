ASSUMPTIONS
-DONE: the wifiCommunicator will only be initialized once for each power on of the pi0. Thus, the lightModuleClients should
continue to be stored even if the light gets disconnected from the base station and reconnected, although the corresponding
port numbers will change. (In the case of being disconnected from the base station, I should consult with the team as to 
what happens) 

-MAINLY DONE but main loop must also be changed: I am adding a variable to store the current actual state of the light module in each lightModuleClient. 
When initializing the wifiCommunicator class, I will add parameters for the main loop program to fill in this 
actual state variable with the actual current state of the light.
The wifiRecommendedStateVariable will be initialized to an unknown state until the pi0 connects to a basestation and attempts
to change the said state.

-DONE: MAINLY DONE but needs to be cleaned up, especially in the wificommunicator functions: It is the job of the multiconnclientclass program to deal with confirming for the basestation that the light has
actually changed state (ie name, brightness, etc.). Ie process as follows: state change request received; wifiRecommendedStateVariable
changes (perhaps we should also change the actual current state variable to unknown); then the confirm state is called by the main program
and the actual current state variable is updated with that; then whenever the basestation wants to confirm a change it calls with a confirm 
command over the wifi, where the pi0 checks if the actual and recommended variables match yet

-DONE: TO BE DONE ie with the try catch: I have to have a plan for what to do when the piui disconnects from the base station. In this case
I think the base station will continue to hold all the information about all the lights. I should ask the
rest of the team whether we should inform the light modules that the piui has been disconnected from them.
In theory it is possible to go without informing the light modules whne the piui gets disconnected and instead
deal with this issue only in the basestation, as there are no commands that the light modules have to perform
which require confirmation from the piui.
If the piui gets disconnected, I can assume that the wifiRecommendedStateVariable will remain what it was before the piui
got disconnected.
If the pi0 is disconnected from the base station, I will set wifiRecommendedStateVariables to None.

-DONE: Start wifiState in the same state as the current actualState

-LATER: I WILL ASLO HAVE TO ADD A TIMER COMPLETE OFF STATE FOR THE LIGHT, ie I need to figure out adding a triggeredOff state. Also I should
discuss with the others exactly what needs to be done in this situation.

-DONE: I NEED TO MAKE BASE STATION CONNECTION AND RECONNECTION ATTEMPTS KEEP TRYING UNTIL A BASE STATION CONNECTS, instead of only once
and then not continuing to try if the connection is unsuccessful. If will make a queue of light modules that need to be connected but 
have not yet been connected...
